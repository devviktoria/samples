# Mouse Simulator

This is a Mouse Simulator Android application.

## How cats are "playing" with mouses
When a cat catches a mouse for a while he holds it in his mouth or grabs it with his legs. After a short while he lets the mouse go. In that moment the mouse, of course, runs for his life. Then the cat is grabbing him again. This cycle happens while the mouse is alive.

## The goal of the app
This application is a cat toy app. The goal of the app is to simulate the above mouse behavior for cats. For more information see the [Requirement Specification](requirements/requirements.md)

## Technical information about the app
This app is written in Flutter, in the null safety version of it. It targets the Android platform. I am using Visual Studio Code to develop it. 

This project is no quite finished yet, but I think it getting close to being finished.
