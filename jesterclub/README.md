# Jester Club Web Site
This is going to be a simple website about jokes.
Currently I started working on the backend of the site, which is a Web API that uses a MongoDB database.

## Technical information
 Web API: It's written in C# it uses the ASP.NET Core 5 Web API technology and the MongoDB's C# driver.
